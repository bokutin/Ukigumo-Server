*How can I deploy a ukigumo server on dotcloud?
You can deploy a Ukigumo server very easy.

1st, you would setup dotcloud account.

2nd, you would setup dotcloud cli.

3rd, just deploy it with:
>||
% dotcloud create <i>fusihara-</i>ukigumo
% dotcloud push <i>fusihara-</i>ukigumo
||<

Very easy. If you want to use ukigumo as a private mode, you should put a following line on app.psgi.
>||
enable "Auth::Basic", authenticator => sub { return $_[0] eq 'admin' && $_[1] eq 'admin'; }
||<
